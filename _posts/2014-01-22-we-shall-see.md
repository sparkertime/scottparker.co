A farmer was tending to his crops when his beloved horse escaped and ran away. "Such misfortune," his neighbors said. "We shall see," the farmer replied.

The horse returned, bringing with it several wild horses. "What a blessing," the neighbors said. "We shall see," the farmer replied.

As the farmer's son was tending to the wild horses, one kicked back and broke the son's legs. "What tragedy," the neighbors said. "We shall see," the farmer replied.

Soon after the local magistrate came to enlist young men into the war. Upon seeing the farmer's son was crippled, he moved on. "Such wonderful news," the neighbors said.

"We shall see," the farmer replied.

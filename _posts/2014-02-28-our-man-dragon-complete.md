My goal was to finish Our Man Dragon in February, and I did so with 52 minutes to spare!

Obviously it's still rough around the edges and isn't the most attractive thing, but I completed [all the major features](https://trello.com/b/YmWcjwZA/our-man-dragon) I planned.

My goal in finishing this was to learn the ropes in each major feature of making a game. Short of sound effects, visuals, and controller input, I did just that.

### What's Next

In order to make a complete game I am proud of, it isn't enough to have interesting gameplay. I need to at least hack together compelling music or visuals. If I am ever to make something I am proud of, I can probably afford a professional for one of those two, but not both.

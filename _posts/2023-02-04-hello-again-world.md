Cracking the case of "Who killed scottparker.co ?" is not particularly hard - it was Scott Parker, at his desk, with inactivity.

"Why?" is perhaps more interesting. Why have I stopped writing on this site? Sure it's a navel-gazing topic of limited interest, but it's not like I'm using this site for anything else right now.

<hr>

The heyday of this blog began in 2005 when my soon-to-be-wife said "every nerd I've ever met has a half-built website that's perpetually 'coming soon'." That was all I needed to finish coding it in PHP the following weekend. This golden age lasted for about a decade until 2015 or so when posts gradually slowed from a stream to a trickle to what is now, if I'm generous, an occasional drip.

## The usual suspects

Much has been made of social media's impact on blogging but Twitter was only a minor factor. Tweeting never took the place of blogging exactly but I think my brain became accustomed to thinking in 140 characters. Blog posts started feeling like so much _work_ whereas they used to be a relaxing, natural outlet.

Aging also played a role. Words take somewhat more effort now, forcing me to spend more time with each sentence. Age also cooled some of the fires that inspired me to write in the first place. Early posts were frequently borne from playful frustration, outrages I felt, or outrages I wanted to instigate. I'm an old, boring man now – things are fine and people are fine but no one wants to read a post entitled "Hey, everything is fine and I guess that's fine."

## With very little power comes great, possibly imaginary responsibility

Both of the factors above pale in comparison to the impact of my career. Since 2015, I've held increasingly senior management roles. Before, I ran small teams that I would have called "an organization" only in my most pompous moments. For the past seven years though, I've ranged from being someone's boss' boss to being someone's boss' boss' boss' boss' boss, the latter being a nightmare of both organizational complexity and possessive nouns.

My folder of unfinished blog drafts became as unruly as my org charts. I'd write for a few moments and then wonder "Could someone in my organization take offense? Could someone take this out of context?" In large organizations, the answer is "yes."  Always. I'd abandon the draft shortly after this inevitable realization and decide yet another topic was off-limits.

> Sidebar: There's a reason that your VP probably doesn't talk much. It is often just an opportunity for unforced errors, a way to create problems where none previously existed. People will get hurt, or they'll think you're playing favorites, or minor omissions will balloon into major problems after people inevitably compare notes. The odds of a problem are low in any single interaction but you talk all day so it's bound to happen sooner or later. Eventually it's just easier to be boring.

There's other career baggage too - the pressure to be some kind of inspirational thought leader or the fear that my words could bring shame upon my employer. Every so often a job candidate would mention they looked at my blog and I would think "shit, I wonder what stupid shit they found that I should take down or whether they found me using words like 'shit' on my blog."

I'm sure much of this was self-inflicted, the product of an anxious imagination. Nonetheless, these forces combined to make this site a ghost town where the only posts are sporadic, silly takes on games. It's not that those posts are unauthentic – [Edge of the Empire](https://scottparker.co/a-review-of-edge-of-the-empire-via-player-aid/) really is just a so-so roleplaying game and I still have mixed feelings about the board game [Here I Stand](https://scottparker.co/sparker-the-eight-here-i-stand/) – but these represent a single and increasingly small part of my life.

### Okay Great, We Get It. So What?

For a variety of reasons that are topics for another time, I'm very happy to have stepped out of senior management roles and start a new gig at [DekuDeals](https://dekudeals.com) as a... well, I don't really know what to call my job and I have zero interest in sorting that out. But I know what it isn't – it's not Vice President of anything and I am delighted to lead an organization of zero direct reports.

I know myself too well to pretend this means the floodgates have now opened. Every other factor above remains true and I have no desire to add to the vast number of blogs where the latest post is ancient and says merely "I have so much to say! Watch this space!"

But I look forward to writing solely for my own pleasure once again at some irregular pace.

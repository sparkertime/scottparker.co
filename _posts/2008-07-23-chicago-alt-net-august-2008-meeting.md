The August 2008 meeting of the Chicago Alt.Net group has been announced by fearless leader [Sergio Pereira](http://devlicio.us/blogs/sergio_pereira/). It will be on August 13th, 2008 at 6:00 PM (or 6:30P if you don't want pizza, but c'mon, pizza!) in the Chicago ThoughtWorks office at 200 E. Randolph St, Chicago, IL 60611.

It's free to attend, but if you're interested in attending you should [register for the event](http://altnetchicago.eventbrite.com/). Otherwise you'll have trouble getting in the building.

The topic will be Continuous Integration (CI). The meeting will start off with a talk from the lead developer of [Cruise](http://studios.thoughtworks.com/cruise/), a soon-to-be-released commercial continuous integration tool from the makers of open-source CI darling CruiseControl.Net, and then branch out into general discussion of CI best practices / whatever-the-crap-else-comes-up.

It should be interesting, as according to the developer, "CC.Net is deprecated." Big words.

If you're new to Alt.Net (or .Net in general), you're absolutely welcome to attend. For more information on what the whole Alt.Net thing is about, please visit the [Alt.Net Community](http://altdotnet.org/).

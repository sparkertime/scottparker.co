It's been awhile since I've provided an update on Our Man Dragon, so allow me to rectify that.

It's not uncommon for software projects to spend just as much time going from "start" to "basically done" as they do to go from "basically done" to "done." Our Man Dragon is no different - the basic gameplay was hammered out in a day while I am on month two of "finishing up."

However, it's dramatically _more_ challenging to stay motivated towards the end of this game than the many non-game software projects in my career. The crux is that all of my work is now towards making sure a new player knows what they are supposed to do as well as I do. This means GUIs, intro screens, etc. 

It feels tedious, but this is important work. Even though this is not a particularly fun game, I want it to be a complete game so that I have experienced each part of releasing a game. This has always been a learning project so I am determined to finish this before moving on to something more interesting.

For the curious, you can track my remaining work on the [Our Man Dragon Trello board](https://trello.com/b/YmWcjwZA/our-man-dragon).

Just wanted to take a moment and capture some random thoughts about MadisonRuby.

**Thanks everyone** who came to Dan's and my talk today at [MadisonRuby](http://madisonruby.org). This has been a tremendous conference so far and I'm honored to be a part of it. If you have any follow-up questions, I'd love to continue the conversation. Feel free to [contact me](/contact) or [find me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/citizenparker).

**Madison is** perhaps the loveliest town I've ever been to. Although I'm not sure I get the whole cheese thing. I've spent a fair amount of time elsewhere in Wisconsin and so I'm familiar with cheesemania. However, Madison takes this to a whole new level. My heart no longer pumps but instead goes "squelch" every so often.

**Special moments** abound at this conference. It's an incredible conference with a special ethos - lots of hugs and affection everywhere. Sometimes I forget there's special connections everywhere in the Ruby community.  It's such a marvelous experience, thanks guys. [Big Tiger](http://twitter.com/#!/jremsikjr) in particular, you've been totally awesome. I am in your debt for these moments.

**I've included** some of my favorite MadisonRuby moments below courtesy of [twip.us](http://twip.us) - you can view their entire [MadisonRuby collection here](http://twip.us/madison-ruby-2011).

As I said when introducing my [compact NPC character sheet](/ffg-star-wars-compact-npc-character-sheet/), I hate clutter at the table. The FFG vehicle sheet is fantastic for my players’ ship as they want to track everything at a fair level of detail. Not only is that overkill for most NPC vehicles, but I also don’t want to have to remember “Okay, now which NPC sheet is the driver of this vehicle again?”

I made an combined sheet that condenses the most critical information on NPC vehicles and their crew. You can see it in action with the stats for a “CSA TAST-A”, a somewhat crap airspeeder used by CorpSec planetside police in my campaign:

A few notes about this sheet:

* This sheet makes pretty extensive use of scripts to calculate die rolls. You’ll probably want to open it in Adobe Reader to make use of them.
* If your printer doesn’t support half-sheets, these also print nicely two to a page. What I usually do on my Mac OSX is:
  * Select all the NPCs I want to print for a session in Finder
  * Open them in Preview (this opens all the separate PDFs as one document)
  * Print, and under “Layout” select “Pages per Sheet: 2”

Changes or suggestions are welcome! All the tools I used to make this are free to use, and all the original materials are available for download or modification in the [Github repository](https://github.com/citizenparker/EotE-NPC-Sheet/). Pull requests are welcome!

Happy GMing!

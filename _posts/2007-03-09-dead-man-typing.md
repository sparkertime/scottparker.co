I misspelled "your" today in a business email. I won't go into the messy details; it's too painful right now.

You may forgive me, but I'll never forgive myself. I should add my name to the List o' Shame I keep in my office.

I feel a self-loathing-fueled alcohol binge weekend coming on. Time to channel my inner Hunter S. Thompson.

title:  Digital Memories - Snapshots of Geocities Research

The Tumblr [One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age](http://oneterabyteofkilobyteage.tumblr.com/) is my new obsession. The Tumblr is a snapshot of archived Geocities pages in chronological order. I've posted some of the more interesting below.

The [blog of the research project taking these screenshots](http://blog.geocities.institute/) is fascinating as well. It captures a time when hordes of new users were trying to create on the internet. What strikes me is not how many are clearly unfamiliar with the "how" of creating their own homepages, but also with the "why". This archive is littered with people writing statements to the effect of "I don't know why I am doing this and don't have anything to say, but..."

Definitely check it out.

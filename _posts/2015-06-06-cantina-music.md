An interesting question came up on the SWRPG subreddit - [what music do you use for a cantina beyond just the Star Wars classics](http://www.reddit.com/r/swrpg/comments/38rbqf/aside_from_the_obvious_what_kind_of_music_would/)? I actually keep such a playlist of fun and wierd music that I can see playing in the restaurants and clubs of Star Wars.

* [Chain Reaction - Steroid Maximus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58JCtleJ3X8)

* [Melnorme Theme - Star Control 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAI7jyGJmgo)

It's worth noting that I don't actually play these all that often at the table (I usually have some music playing, but worrying about switching playlists is just a distration). These are *tremendous* when it comes to game preparation though. I can put on the right playlist and jump straight into the mood.

I’m proud to share something I’ve been working on for the past few months, [swsheets.com](http://swsheets.com).

**Right now this is in Beta mode. I'm making every effort not to do anything dumb that would cause me to wipe all the data or something equally catastrophic, but I don't make any promises. I expect to be out of beta in 1-2 weeks.**

swsheets.com is a website for creating and sharing characters for Fantasy Flight Games’ Star Wars: Edge of the Empire RPG. Right now it’s rather basic and only allows you to create, edit, and delete characters. I hope to add in printing to PDF next, but that’s a rather complicated task.

Please take a look and let me know if you have any feedback or thoughts. You can add bug reports to [the Github Issue page](https://github.com/citizenparker/swsheets/issues) and you are welcome to give me any other feedback you have by commenting below.

SWSheets is completely open source and I happily accept pull requests. [Check it out on Github](https://github.com/citizenparker/swsheets).

Thanks!

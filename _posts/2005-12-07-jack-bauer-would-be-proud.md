In the past 24 hours, I have:

* accepted a full-time job with [Sonoma Partners](http://www.sonomapartners.com/)
* purchased the new season of 24 (complete with clip-on watch!)
* worked on my Compilers project only to have a bizarre Deus Ex Machina save everyone involved, much like in crappy thriller movies where a minor character from the first Act returns in Act III to save the protagonist
* turned down an admin position on the website [NationStates](http://www.nationstates.net/)
* easily had my best night of improv ever.

Oh yeah, and this: **I took my final presentation for my graphics class less than seriously**

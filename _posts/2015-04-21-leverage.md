A great moment from Leverage where Parker is forced to pretend she’s not a master thief.

I have to find a way to steal this for my RPG campaign. So many of my favorite roleplaying moments come from when a character is forced to go far outside their comfort zones. It’s hard because that oftentimes means taking actions that the _characters_ are bad at.

The times I’ve done this around inexperienced or goal-focused rleplayers, I’ve nearly caused riots. (the time at GenCon where my character was offered any weapon in the modern world I could ask for and he picked a taser was a great example).

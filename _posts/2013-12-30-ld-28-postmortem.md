When I [last submitted an Ludum Dare game](/ld23-its-over-a-postmortem), I gave myself an MS Paint trophy. I submitted another game, one I daresay is a bit better than the last, so here's my reward.

_that's some CGI right there in case you can't tell._

This LD was a blast. I spent the weekend hacking with four colleagues from Braintree and we had ourselves a hootenanny.

The game is more or less as I had imagined, albeit with a few missing bells and whistles. The last big gameplay feature where villagers build huts is still in-progress, and it could really use a GUI to tell you what's going on. Still, remarkably complete, especially when compared to how very far short I fell last time.

## What Worked Well
* __Knowing Unity__ - this time around, I knew the tools somewhat before going in. I have yet to finish a game in Unity, but I have banged out a couple of rough prototypes prior to this. In particular, the [Catlike Coding tutorials](http://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/) were very helpful.
* __Comradery__ - While I remain a fan of the solo format, leaving home to gather with like-minded hackers was extremely helpful. Just as in my daily work, my colleagues inspire me to be better than I am.
* __One Fun Thing__ - I took [Tom Francis' advice](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btYWNND2vo0) and made a game around one fun mechanic and prototyped that mechanic immediately. I spent a lot of time making sure the fire-breathing looked and felt just so, but I think that was time extremely well spent. It's still fun to fly around and set things on fire, even if you don't understand what the game is really about.

## What Didn't Go Well
* __3D Modeling__ - I realized I needed better tooling to make the ork fortresses, which is where I started to spin my wheels. Google Sketchup is a straightforward enough tool, but I really found it hard to navigate. I have a license to Blender somewhere - I need to dig it up and rediscover that tool.
* __Visuals__ - These aren't my strong suit. I cheated by going for a very basic look (one commenter compared it to Darwinia), but even then I spent more time on them than I ought to have. I don't know what the solution is here though.

## Other Miscellaneous Thoughts
I really had fun with this. One of my 2014 New Year's Resolutions is to try and make a game every quarter. I have a few things I'd like to experiment with - in particular, I want to see how hard it is to make an online multiplayer game. I am going to finish up Our Man Dragon first though.

As always, thanks to the organizers for making this happen. LD is a very special event for me.

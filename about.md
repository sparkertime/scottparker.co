Hello! I'm Scott Parker. I generally prefer the pronouns he / him but I don't care too much as long as I know you're talking to me.

## Work

Currently, I am a Director of Engineering with [Root Insurance](https://root.engineering) where I head up our Chicago engineering office. Before that, I've held leadership roles at a number of Chicago tech companies including [Signal](https://www.signal.co/) (not the messaging app), [Reverb](https://reverb.com), and [Braintree](https://braintreepayments.com).

## Everything Else

Outside of work, I do many things but [roleplaying](/category/roleplaying) is my chief hobby. I also make pies from time to time.

## Projects

I'm the founder and primary administrator of [SWSheets](http://swsheets.com) and [TI4Rules](https://ti4rules.github.io/).

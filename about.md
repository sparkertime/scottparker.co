Hello! I'm Scott Parker.

## Work

I'm proud to be part of the team at [dekudeals.com](https://dekudeals.com). Prior to that, I've had software engineering leadership roles at a number of tech companies. Outside of work, I do many things but [roleplaying](/category/roleplaying) is my chief hobby and [RPG Seeker](https://rpgseeker.com) is my passion project. I also make pies from time to time, and cook a number of other recipes that [you can find here](https://recipes.scottparker.co).

## Other Side Projects

I built [SWSheets](http://swsheets.com) and [TI4Rules](https://ti4rules.github.io/)

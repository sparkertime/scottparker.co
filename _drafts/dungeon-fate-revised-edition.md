title: Dungeon Fate, Revised Edition

When I last [discussed my Dungeon World / Fate mashup]({{"/dungeon-fate" | absolute_url}}), I left mostly happy but for the probabilities - everything was a little too easy on the players. I have mostly fixed that with a couple of hacks that I wanted to share. 

Rob made a good point in the footnote to [a subsequent Blades post](http://walkingmind.evilhat.com/2018/08/15/bites-in-the-dark/) that you lose some of FATE's magic when it is too hard by default. Specifically, I run the risk of deprecating compels, GM invocations against the players' rolls. This is a fair point and a challenge I run up against often in FFG Star Wars[^1].

## Dice Rolling

As before, you build a pool of FATE dice, roll, and take the highest result.[^2] A + is success, a blank is a partial success, and a - is failure.

So far, so standard. Here's the new difficulty ladder for Dungeon Fate, Revised Edition:
 
| Rank | Fail (-) | Partial ( ) | Success (+) |
|-|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **Terrible** - Lowest 1 of 4dF | 80.25% | 18.52% | 1.23% |
| **Poor** - Lowest 1 of 3dF |70.37% | 25.93% | 3.70% |
| **Mediocre** - Lowest 1 of 2dF | 55.56% | 33.33% | 11.11% |
| **Good** - 1dF | 33.33% | 33.33% | 33.33% |
| **Great** - 2dF | 11.11% | 33.33% | 55.56% |
| **Superb** - 3dF | 3.70% | 25.93% | 70.37% |
| **Fantastic** - 4dF | 1.23% | 18.52% | 80.25% |

These labels are just one step down from the first version and adds some new levels of failure below that. That makes mixed results just a little more common for most things without making it cruel to add compels into a roll.

As before I use a 1/2/3 approach distribution for new characters. One approach at Great, two at Good, and three at Mediocre.

## Stunts

In the last edition, I mentioned I dropped stunts entirely but was still noodling on how to bring them back. Once again, Rob had a great idea:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Quick stunt trick: Stunt effects are triggered by spending a plus die (rather than applying it to the result).</p>&mdash; Rob Donoghue (@rdonoghue) <a href="https://twitter.com/rdonoghue/status/1029778059283640320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 15, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This is a fantastic idea but requires some tweaks to the standard Fate Accelerated stunts. Many of them take the form of "When doing X, get an advantage on the associated roll." This stunt form inverts that a bit since you'd only be declaring stunts after the roll.

Thankfully, I play another game that has a _ton_ of this post-roll effects, FFG Star Wars. I'm making a list of what I'm calling "stunt starters" based on these various sources that would give players some new templates for stunts.

## Everything Else

Aside from that, everything else from [the first post]({{"/dungeon-fate" | absolute_url}}) is basically the same. I need to clarify how post-roll fate point spends work now that the ladder extends further into "take the lowest" but I want to try a few ideas out before committing to anything.

All this means that there's one more post on this game coming sometime in the future. Once that one is written, I'll writeup a complete SRD and post it somewhere.

A huge thanks to emarsk and their [dice statistics collection](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6rIPreVMNRZWmhLOWJsQmxwdFE) which really helped me find the right sweet spot for difficulty with these dice.

[^1]: In FFG Star Wars rules-as-written, there can only ever be one destiny point spent on a roll and players get first dibs. Thus my GM spends are pretty arbitrary - I'm almost always spending destiny points whenever I'm allowed to because I don't have the chance on rolls that matter. As [I've said before](TBD) I have a love/hate relationship with that system.

[^2]: I tried a variety of different dice systems before I decided to stay close to the last post's version. In particular, I really liked the probability curve for "Roll XdF, count successes only and treat 2 as success, 1 as mixed, 0 as failure"

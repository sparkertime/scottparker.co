title: "Things I Liked Most in 2019"
---

I'm terrible for "best of" lists because I operate on a timescale disconnected from such mundane concerns as "new" or "calendars." In other words, I am generally out of the loop and usually far behind the zeitgeist.

So rather than focus on a list on what came out in 2019, this is a list of my favorite things I experienced for the first time in 2019. With no further fanfare, here is the **List of Things Scott Liked Most in 2019**

<hr />

### **TV**: Chernobyl (2019)

In a year where I feared the golden age of television was ending, Chernobyl gave me enough hope to continue. I was raised on disaster movies like EARTHQUAKE (1974) and THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE (1972). Since I loved Jared Harris in the flawed-but-beautiful THE TERROR, CHERNOBYL was a no-brainer.

I had no idea what I was in for. CHERNOBYL is an intense, haunting miniseries about our ability to break the world around us with powers we understand without appreciating. It is the most haunting, most alien show I watched. Expertly cast, beautifully shot, and with a crazed otherworldly score, it is unlike anything else on TV this year.

__See also__: As I mentioned, there are fewer TV shows I loved in 2019 than in years past. **FLEABAG (2019)** is the only other show that came close â€“ a hilarious and moving show about trying and failing to live with oneself.

### **Video Game**: Battletech (2018)

I played far fewer computer games in 2019 than in any year since I was too broke to buy games. Part of this is because I think I'm moving on from videogaming. Part of this is because BATTLETECH didn't leave much time for anything else.

I've played a number of XCOM-alikes, but BATTLETECH was the first to combine XCOM's amazing presentation values with a new aesthetic, new form of combat, and new strategic layer. It took a number of battles before I learned BATTLETECH is a game of position instead of cover. Of gradual attrition instead of knockout blows. Of choosing when to fall back versus when to push just a little harder.

As [my old livestreams can attest](https://youtu.be/hz_SXnHm2Z0?t=365), XCOM was a game that made me swear. Battletech is its own beast, a game that makes me sigh, total up the latest repair bill in my mind, and wonder how my pitiful mercenary company will ever recover from this fresh debacle.

__See also__: **UNTITLED GOOSE GAME (2019)** is an extremely innovative take on the stealth action game, but I can't say I loved playing it. I was obsessed by the puzzles of **BABA IS YOU (2019)** until I hit a wall of difficulty.   [The music still haunts me, however](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykZCR8BB9pM).

### **Book, Fiction**: All Systems Red (2017)

{% include figure caption='Until books ship with soundtracks, covers will have to do' image_path="/images/draft-all-systems-red.png" %}

Who would have guessed that a book about a robot that just wants to be left alone to watch TV would be full of such heart, excitement, and hilarity? This robot is one of the most original and yet relatable characters I've encountered in science fiction.

I absolutely adored this teensy little book. While it's a novella, it doesn't skimp on the plot, characters, or setting. There's clearly a lot to this universe, but the story of ALL SYSTEMS RED is smaller and more local. As a result, there's an intimacy with the characters that I rarely feel in longer sci-fi books that carry a ponderous burden to comment on our society today. But as I said before, Murderbot is very today - the character gets me in a way few others seem to.

I could write endlessly about how much I enjoyed this, but the 700 episodes of TV I've been downloading while writing this aren't going to watch themselves, you know.

__See also__: I loved **EROTIC STORIES FOR PUNJABI WIDOWS (2017)** - it was a fascinating lens through which to view a culture I'm unfamiliar with. It would probably have been my favorite if not for a needless thriller-esque third act. **KILLING GRAVITY (2017)** was the second-best novella I read, a story of learning how to survive friendships when you are able to fry spaceships with your mind.

### **Book, Non-Fiction**: TIE - Thinking in Bets (2019), Come As You Are (2015), Thinking Fast & Slow (2011)

While I didn't read much non-fiction this year, almost every book I read was fantastic. Try as I might, I cannot pick one of these books to stand above the other two.

**THINKING IN BETS** felt like someone wrote a book just for me. In it, professional poker player Annie Duke shares the cognitive habits that helped make her game. If you've participated in one of my premortems or heard me express my plans as confidence intervals, you've seen this book's effects upon me. It has changed my career.

**COME AS YOU ARE** was definitely _not_ written for me, but I still loved it nonetheless. Emily Nagoski has written a fascinating and informative look at the modern science of women's sexuality. It's less "self-help" and instead more "self-awareness" (as the title implies, you're basically already great). It gave me and my wife a rich set of vocabulary to discuss this part of our relationship, even as it left me with a lot of questions about how I work as a male.

I feel silly for putting off **THINKING FAST AND SLOW** for as long as I did. It is probably Daniel Kahneman's masterpiece - many short chapters, each centered on one kind of cognitive bias or error, all framed in laymen's terms and with exercises to prove that you too are biased. It has influenced how I interview candidates, how I evaluate risk, and how I feel about my own happiness. Make no mistake - it is a dense tome that can sometimes feel like work. It was easily worth it, though.

(it's worth noting that I discovered two of these through the excellent [Knowledge Project podcast](https://fs.blog/the-knowledge-project/))

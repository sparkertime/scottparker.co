title: "Things I Liked Most in 2019"
---

I'm terrible at "best of" lists because I operate on a timescale disconnected from concepts like "new" or "calendars." I am generally out of the loop and usually far behind the zeitgeist.

Instead of a typical "best of" list, these are some of my favorite things I first experienced in 2019. With no further fanfare, here is the **List of Things Scott Liked Most in 2019**

### **TV**: Chernobyl (2019)

CHERNOBYL is an intense, haunting miniseries about our ability to break the world around us with powers we understand without appreciating. Perfectly cast, beautifully shot, and with a crazed otherworldly score, it was unlike anything else on TV this year.

__See also__: As I mentioned, there are fewer TV shows I loved in 2019 than in years past. **FLEABAG (2019)** is the only other show that came close â€“ a hilarious and moving show about trying and failing to live with oneself.

### **Video Game**: Battletech (2018)

I played far fewer games in 2019 than ever before. Part of this is because I think I'm moving on from videogaming. Part of this is because BATTLETECH didn't leave much time for anything else.

It took a number of battles before I learned BATTLETECH is more than just another XCOM-alike a game of position instead of cover. Of gradual attrition instead of knockout blows. Of choosing when to fall back versus when to push just a little harder.

As [my old livestreams can attest](https://youtu.be/hz_SXnHm2Z0?t=365), XCOM was a game that made me swear. BATTLETECH is its own beast, a game that makes me sigh, total up the latest repair bill in my mind, and wonder how my pitiful mercenary company will ever recover from this fresh debacle.

__See also__: **UNTITLED GOOSE GAME (2019)** is an innovative take on stealth action games, but I can't say I loved playing it. I was obsessed by the puzzles of **BABA IS YOU (2019)** until I hit a wall of difficulty. [The music still haunts me, however](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykZCR8BB9pM).

### **Book, Fiction**: All Systems Red (2017)

{% include figure caption='Until books ship with soundtracks, covers will have to do' image_path="/images/draft-all-systems-red.png" %}

Murderbot is a humanoid weapons platform that just wants to be left alone to watch. This robot is one of the most original and yet relatable characters I've encountered in science fiction.

I absolutely adored this teensy little book. While it's a novella, it doesn't skimp on the plot, characters, or setting. There's clearly a lot to this universe, but the story of ALL SYSTEMS RED is smaller and more local. As a result, there's an intimacy with the characters that I rarely feel in longer sci-fi books that carry the burden of societal commentary. But as I said before, Murderbot is very today - the character gets me in a way few others seem to.

I could write endlessly about how much I enjoyed this, but the 700 episodes of TV I've been downloading while writing this aren't going to watch themselves, you know.

__See also__: I loved **EROTIC STORIES FOR PUNJABI WIDOWS (2017)** - it was a fascinating lens through which to view a culture I'm unfamiliar with. It would probably have been my favorite if not for a needless thriller-esque third act. **KILLING GRAVITY (2017)** was the second-best novella I read, a story of learning how to navigate friendships when you are able to fry spaceships with your mind.

### **Book, Non-Fiction**: TIE - Thinking in Bets (2019), Come As You Are (2015), Thinking Fast & Slow (2011)

While I didn't read much non-fiction this year, almost every book I read was fantastic. Try as I might, I cannot pick one of these books to stand above the other two.

**THINKING IN BETS** felt like someone wrote a book just for me. In it, professional poker player Annie Duke shares the cognitive habits that helped make her game. If you've participated in one of my premortems or heard me express my plans as confidence intervals, you've seen this book's effects upon me. It has changed my career.

**COME AS YOU ARE** was definitely _not_ written for me, but I still loved it nonetheless. Emily Nagoski has written a fascinating and informative look at the modern science of women's sexuality. It's less "self-help" and instead more "self-awareness" (as the title implies, you're basically already great). I still find myself a bit confusing, but at least I better understand my spouse.

I feel silly for putting off **THINKING FAST AND SLOW** for as long as I did. The book is many short chapters, each centered on one cognitive bias or error, all framed in laymen's terms and with exercises to prove that you too are biased. It has influenced how I interview candidates, how I evaluate risk, and how I feel about my own happiness. Make no mistake - it is a dense tome that can sometimes feel like work. It was easily worth it, though.

(it's worth noting that I discovered two of these through the excellent [Knowledge Project podcast](https://fs.blog/the-knowledge-project/))

### **RPG**: Scum & Villainy (2019)

I really enjoyed reading BLADES IN THE DARK, but the Dishonored-inspired setting left me cold. SCUM & VILLAINY was exactly what I needed then - it adapts BitD into several different "sci-fi, but..." kinds of settings.

The player choices are rich, the setting is deeply flavorful, and the dice mechanics present players and GMs alike with meaty choices at the table. I'm hopeful that 2020 sees a lot more SCUM & VILLAINY at our table. 

__See also__: I did a better job Troika (and a bunch I haven't checked out yet)

### **Recipe**: Spicy Sun-dried Tomato & Broccoli Pasta

[A recipe? Sure, why not](https://cookieandkate.com/spicy-sun-dried-tomato-and-broccoli-pasta/).

2019 was the year we transitioned to a primarily pescatarian diet. I imagined flavorful vegetarian meals wereweeknight, but this dish became a quick, spicy staple of our new diet.

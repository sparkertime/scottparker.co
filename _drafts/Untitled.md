# Untitled Motivation Talk

"Building a boat isn’t about weaving canvas, forging nails, or reading the sky. It’s about giving a shared taste for the sea." -Antoine de Saint-Exupéry?

But also motivation without organization is futile.

## Exploring Motivation
* "To prompt her, ask questions such as: “What do you want to be known for?” or “What matters most to you?”" https://hbr.org/2009/12/giving-a-high-performer-produc

* Barankay (2011) showed that a majority (75%) of people say they want to know how they are rated (or ranked in this case), but when given the opportunity to choose between a job where their performance was rated against others and one where it was not, most choose the work without ratings (https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/industrial-and-organizational-psychology/article/getting-rid-of-performance-ratings-genius-or-folly-a-debate/215B47ABDD0DEE3B55BE747B87FFDCBC)
* Weak performers will leave organizations that strongly reward high performance (e.g., Lazear, 1986). Corresponding to the finding regarding low salary growth, Trevor, Gerhart, and Boudreau (1997) showed that high salary growth is related to higher turnover among low performers but to low turnover among top performers
* the goal is to "instill a commitment to self-improvement" and then provide guideposts and support for that self-improvement

## Intro
* Set the context - trying to change the behaviors within a team. Could be a big deliverable or challenge ahead.
* Wisdom is the accumulation of failure. These are the things I have tried, failed, and grown wiser from.

## Moving Speeches
* Still have to keep this in check - I can talk endlessly
* The scene from every sports movie ever where the coach inspires greatness from their players
* Why it doesn't work
	* Emotional levels
	* ???
* BUT
	* always frame the context for what people are doing and why it is important
	* Let people hear from their leaders, both capital-L and lowercase l

## Lead by Example
* NO! But this is good advice, right?
* I challenge the "Lead" part of this advice.
* Problem with humans is that we aren't parables, stories crafted to impact a single lesson that is pretty hard to miss.
* Example: Jesus and the disciples. Followed him around basically 24/7 and yet still constantly missed the point.
* People might pick up *something* but it is rarely the thing you want them to pick up.
* BUT
	* Always let your conduct be unimpeachable. If you are in a leader, the excuse "But THEY did it" can never be applied to you.
	* In other words, act like this works, but understand it doesn't work.

## Anger
	* But be stern when you need to

## Hope and Trust
	* But be an optimist anyway (hope for the best, plan for the worst)

## Competition Against Others
	
## Misc
* Kahneman and feedback - don't focus on just the negative feedback you make or you will get a false sense of accomplishment as people revert to "normal" anyway.
* No single thing - change is the result of accumulated feedback and coaching, not a single, inspiring action.
* All of these lose their value in repetition.

## Hiring, Honest, and Motivation

In 1914, Englishman Ernest Shackleton set out to cross Antarctica’s frozen terrain and reach the South Pole. Winter came early, and he and his crew became trapped in ice for 10 months. Shackleton and some of his men traveled 800 miles in small lifeboats to bring help to the rest of the crew. Nobody on his crew died or tried to overthrow his leadership. 

 Shackleton had hired the right people. His newspaper ad read, “Men wanted for hazardous journey. Small wages, bitter cold, long months of complete darkness, constant danger, safe return doubtful. Honor and recognition in case of success.”
 
"When you compete against everyone else, no one wants to help you. But when you compete against yourself, everyone wants to help you."

## Role modeling and motivation
The research results were sometimes counterintuitive, Cullen says. For example, employees worked harder after discovering how much their managers made. For every 1 percent higher in the perceived salary of a manager, employees clocked 0.15 percent more hours.
But the employees’ extra effort diminished as the difference in rank between employee and manager widened. In some cases, “We were looking at how employees responded to managers who were five promotions away and who they explicitly thought were in positions they themselves would never achieve,” Cullen says. In those cases, the work-harder reaction was much smaller but did not become negative.
When employees received salary information about managers who were closer to their own rank, they may have found the salary difference aspirational—just a promotion or two away, she says.

## Manage what you measure

Second, and perhaps more significantly, stellar employees who previously had excellent attendance and were highly productive ended up suffering a 6 to 8 percent productivity decrease after the program was introduced. This suggests that these employees were actually turned off—and their motivation dropped—when the managers introduced awards for good behavior they were already exhibiting.

>>>> This particular attendance award may have been especially flawed because rather than rewarding workers for exceptional performance, it rewarded them for fulfilling a basic job expectation.

## Cheating more likely when there are comparative measures
It turned out Bazerman was right. The researchers found that authors were more likely to download their own papers repeatedly when a colleague's paper was performing especially well on the site, or when a very similar paper to an author's was newly released and received significant downloads. Deceptive downloads also increased during times when a paper was close to gaining (or losing) placement on a top 10 list. (Ironically, one of the most downloaded SSRN papers of all time is 'I've Got Nothing to Hide' and Other Misunderstandings of Privacy.)

## Patty McCord on management
https://getlighthouse.com/blog/patty-mccord-netflix-powerful-culture/
“The more time managers spend communicating and elaborating and being transparent about the job to be done, about the challenges the business is facing and the larger competitive context, the less important policies, approvals, and incentives are.”

# Solve problems with discipline, not process.
“When engineers start to whine about a process …you want to really dig into what’s bothering them, because they hate senseless bureaucracy …But they don’t mind discipline at all.”

## Another thing from Powerful
“Just as great sports teams are constantly scouting for new players and culling others from their lineups, our team leaders would need to continually look for talent and reconfigure team makeup. We set the mandate that their decisions about whom to bring in and who might have to go must be made purely on the basis of the performance their teams needed to produce in order for the company to succeed.”
